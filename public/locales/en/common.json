    "question1": "Are the community service hours offered recognized?",
    "answer1": "Noteswap tries hard to track students' contributions to the platform accurately. We work directly with various schools and universities worldwide to ensure that the community service hours earned through Noteswap are recognized and accepted. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that each university has its distinct criteria for determining what qualifies as community service.",
    "question2": "What can I do to earn community service?",
    "answer2": "Noteswap offers a wide variety of ways to earn community service online. Community service earned through notes is offered directly by Noteswap, while community service earned through tutoring other students and volunteering in events is offered by your local educational institute in collaboration with Noteswap.",
    "question3": "How much community service can I earn per day?",
    "answer3": " Through the means of sharing notes, students can earn 15 minutes a day by typing notes, with an additional 5 minutes for taking pictures of their notes. Tutoring and events offered by educational institutions have no limit to the amount you can earn per day, aside from the fact that you can't earn more than 24 hours per day unless you are an alien.",
    "question4": "Is the platform free to use?",
    "answer5": " Noteswap is completely free of charge for independent learners trying to earn community service, and it offers a paid service for verified educational institutions, providing access to more features.",
